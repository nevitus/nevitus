                <h1>The System: part 1</h1>
                <h2>CAPITAL S</h2>
                <p>The System. Like this, with a capital initial. I don't even know where the name comes from. Perhaps William Gibson first used it in one of his books, referring to a gigantic and senseless something that holds humanity captive.</p>
                <p>We are born into the System, and we die in the System. It is said: a good priest learns till death, a good necromancer beyond. Perhaps the System does not let go even after death, but that is not the subject of this series of articles.</p>
                <p>I do not use the word System in any matrix sense. I do not mean a piece of software installed in our minds. The System is not reality itself. The System is an artificial creation, maintained by the daily work of vast masses of people.</p>
                <h2>THE INNER SYSTEM</h2>
                <p>When I look at a year of my life, I see repetition in my actions. Over and over, over and over again, I do certain things. Just a few of my repetitive activities: writing, eating, exercising. What I repeat, I pile. I repeat the activity of writing, which results in full pages, articles and books throughout the year. I repeat the eating, as a result my body works, maintains, deposits certain toxins. I repeat the exercise, which results in an improvement of my physical condition.</p>
                <p>This system creates certain conditions. To change the conditions, I have to change the components of the system. As long as I don't do this, as long as I don't stop repeating certain actions, as long as I don't start repeating other actions, there will be no change in my life.</p>
                <p>When I look at the system of my own life, I see that there are thoughts and emotions behind the actions. In searching for the source of these, I find the imprint of the outside world on me. So the outer System becomes an inner System. This is not done consciously. If I want to be conscious, I continue to choose from the options offered by the System, to select the elements of my inner system.</p>
                <p>If I want to get out of this, I have to become a determined and professional researcher, to examine, try and test everything. To do this, you need to have extraordinary talents or develop them.</p>
                <h2>THE EXTERNAL SYSTEM</h2>
                <p>The System consists of a repetition of certain physical actions. Behind the actions are thoughts and emotions. Thus, ultimately, the System is both physical and spiritual. If I look for the source of the thoughts and emotions behind the physical manifestations of the System, I find truths and lies. There are also truths in the depths, because the world works, life goes on, the wheels of history turn. There are also lies, because the inhibition is obvious, the perception of vulnerability does not even require a philosophical perspective.</p>
                <p>Ideology is a collection of arguments designed to get a lie accepted. In studying the System, we come across ideologies all the time. This is why it must be done this way, that is why it must be done that way, this is important because of this, that is important because of that. Ideology about how to live and why to live. Ideology about what art is and what its purpose is. Ideology about what science is and what it is for. Ideology about what religion is and what it is for. Ideology about the nature of learning, the nature of curriculum, the purpose of education. Ideology about economics and politics.</p>
                <p>We see that ideologies sell us ideas. If we accept the ideology that politics is this and should be this, then politics will be that. Even if it makes no sense, has no benefit. On the one hand, history is a series of wars fought over ideologies.</p>
                <p>If we don"t want to believe in one ideology, we can. And we will believe in another.</p>
                <p>History is literary fiction, but it can still have a lesson. The lesson is that the System essentially does not change. Egypt, the Roman Empire, Mesopotamia - what has changed since then, in essence?</p>
                <p>Vote for one party or vote for the other. What is the difference in terms of the System? Nothing. The politics are the same, the methods and tools are the same, the power structure is the same, the use of the media is the same. As if it could not be done differently, just like that.</p>
                <p>The purpose of science is not to know reality, but to provide comfort. The highest ultimate goal of psychology and psychiatry is to achieve the so-called normal state, that is - the average person. There are ideologies, no ideals.</p>
                <h2>CONSERVATION</h2>
                <p>The System consists of repetitive actions. These actions are based on recurring (unchanging) thoughts and emotions. The System conserves a state. It does not allow this state to change, deteriorate or improve. It keeps humanity in a certain state, history on a certain track.</p>
                <p>Why? I don't know, I can only guess. This state is not dangerous for the real rulers of the System, but it is just right for humanity to serve them, i.e. to work for them.</p>
                <p>For some time now I have not been so fond of the word System, because I have found another word for it which is more eloquent. For me it is more eloquent. The Machine. With a capital initial.</p>
                <p>A System is a machine. Bigger than anything that is part of it: bigger than the legal system, bigger than politics, the economy, violence, ideologies. Bigger than wars, than crime, than education. Bigger than governments, armies, health, the stock market, business, international conflict.</p>
                <p>The most powerful people we could mention are tiny cogs in the machine. Dictators, warlords, kings, emperors, heads of state - tiny cogs in the machine. We ourselves are cogs, you are a cog, I am a cog.</p>
                <h2>TWO VERISONS</h2>
                <p>There are two possible answers as to why the System exists.</p>
                <p>One answer is that someone created it at some point.</p>
                <p>The other is that the System is us, our thinking, our mental character, it is in us, it comes from us.</p>
                <p>I think the first version is true, our mental state (and not our nature) is just a medium for it.</p>
                <p>Other movements believe otherwise and say: the enemy is us.</p>
                <h2>OPTIONS</h2>
                <p>This article has been about what the System is, and basically how it works.</p>
                <p>In one of my novels, the characters fight against the System and overthrow it. In another novel, aliens visiting Earth negotiate with and agree with prominent figures in the System.</p>
                <p>All my novels to date have featured the System. In one, they use inside information to fight the System with brutal violence. They find the System by inference in a flavor of fear, and their mode of combat is a mixture of manipulation and violence, largely manipulation.</p>
                <p>I believe that it is vain to wait for inside information, indeed we wouldn't even recognise it. To use violence against the System is almost certainly to strengthen the System itself. Therefore these somewhat romantic notions are not feasible for us.</p>
                <p>To ignore the System is merely to deny some elements of the System, nothing more. A head in the sand will not bring change. Marching, raising noise, protesting, guns blazing will not even scratch the System. There is a way to change, but it is something else entirely. That will be the subject of the next article.</p>
                <h2>NOW IT'S YOUR TURN</h2>
                <p>Do you think there is a System? If so, what is it? How does it work? How is it built? Why was it created? Whose interests does it serve? Is the System necessary? Is it possible to have a System that is good? How can the System be changed?</p>
                <p>And something even tougher at the end: can you disconnect from the System? Can you imagine life, this world, without System? Can you imagine a completely different System?</p>
