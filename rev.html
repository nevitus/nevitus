                <p>Everything that people do, including revolution, is somehow tolerable as long as it is done according to human nature. Danton's revolution, however bloody: it is human because it is humane. Passions and human situations collide around the guillotine. A human venture becomes intolerable when it seeks to organise and discipline society not according to the laws of human nature but according to the idea of a principle. Sieburg's "Robespierre" - apart from its tide and ponderous pathos: a book written with conscience and great knowledge of the subject - shows exactly how the French Revolution failed at the moment when Robespierre and Saint-Just wanted to dehumanise a monstrously powerful human venture, because they wanted to train it to a principle: the People as a concept. People can only be vile and heroic in a human way. They need redemption only if it's human.</p>
                <p>One day, a hero will stand up and say that the true purpose of all human endeavour - individual and collective - is not the State, not the Party, not Europe, but the human person, the individual. It is about him as well. This man will be beaten to death. But he will be the first true revolutionary. And if what he says is understood, it will be the first true revolution in the world.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>I no longer believe that any education can permanently cultivate and discipline the lowest human instincts and passions. I no longer believe that man can be just and fair in any other way than from cowardice, necessity, or momentary sentimentality.</p>
